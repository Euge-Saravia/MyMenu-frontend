# Frontend: Meal Planner Application

## Overview

This is the frontend application for a meal and shopping list management system. It allows users to manage weekly meal plans, select and assign plates for each meal (breakfast, lunch, dinner) by day, and interact with a shopping list of products. The app uses React for the user interface, with hooks to manage API requests for adding, updating, and deleting meals and products.

## Features üìã

User Management:
- Meal Plan Management: View, add, and edit meals for each day of the week. Meals include breakfast, lunch, and dinner.
- Product Shopping List: Add, edit, delete individual products, and delete the entire list in a shopping list.
- Meal Assignment: Assign existing plates to meals for specific days.
- Dynamic Meal View: View available meals for each day, with the ability to add, edit, or delete them. 
- API Integration: Uses custom hooks (useApi) to interact with the backend API for meal and product management.
- User Feedback: Displays loading states, error handling, and success messages.

## Technologies Used üõ†Ô∏è

- React: For building the UI.
- React Router: For client-side routing and navigation.
- SASS: For modular and scalable styles.
- Fetch API: For making asynchronous requests to the backend.
- Date-fns: For handling and formatting dates.
